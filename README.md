# phononTB

## This is Tight-binding code for phonon

1. Model Hamiltonian (bulk phonon band, edge phonon band, Willson's loop, Berry curvature, Berry phase, implementation TRS breaking terms, visulization with v_sim...)
1. Read Force constants from phonopy combined with other first-principles calculation codes such as VASP and Quantum Espresso
1. To be implemented: Read FC, Non-equilibrium Green Function (NEGF), phonon-phonon interactions
1. Under development, Not released verison (contact info : hanwooh@gmail.com or hanwooh@kaist.ac.kr)
