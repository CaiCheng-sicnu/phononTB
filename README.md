# phononTB

# This is Tight-binding code for phonon

# 1. Model Hamiltonian (bulk phonon band, edge phonon band, Willson's loop, Berry curvature, Berry phase, implementation TRS breaking terms...)

# 2. Read Force constants from phonopy combined with other first-principles calculation codes such as VASP and Quantum Espresso

# 3. To be implemented: Read FC, Non-equilibrium Green Function (NEGF), visuliazation using v_sim

# 4. Under development, Not released verison

# 5. Contact info: hanwooh@kaist.ac.kr or hanwooh@gmail.com
